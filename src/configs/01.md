## Executive Summary

This documentation provides an in-depth exploration of **bspwm** (Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager) configuration, derived entirely from authoritative web sources. BSPWM is a sophisticated tiling window manager that represents windows as leaves of a full binary tree, controlled entirely through the **bspc** command-line client. This guide comprehensively covers every flag, command-line option, configuration setting, and advanced technique required to create a highly sophisticated and customized BSPWM environment. The documentation is organized to progress from foundational concepts through complex configuration scenarios, with detailed explanations of each component extracted directly from official documentation and community resources.



## Understanding the Architecture and Fundamental Concepts

### The Binary Space Partitioning Model

BSPWM fundamentally operates differently from other tiling window managers through its binary tree architecture. Unlike traditional grid-based layouts, BSPWM represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree, where each split divides the available space into exactly two nodes. This architectural choice provides exceptional flexibility for window arrangements and enables sophisticated manipulation of window layouts through tree operations. The window manager only responds to X11 events and messages received on a dedicated socket, which is handled exclusively through the **bspc** client.

### The Client-Server Model


The relationship between BSPWM and its control interface is built on a socket-based client-server model. BSPWM itself runs as a daemon and listens on a socket for messages from **bspc**, the command-line client that sends configuration commands and window management instructions. This separation provides exceptional modularity and allows complete configuration through shell scripts, making BSPWM exceptionally scriptable compared to window managers that require specialized configuration languages. The socket path, by default, follows the pattern `/tmp/bspwm<hostname>_<display>_<screen>-socket`, but can be customized through the `BSPWM_SOCKET` environment variable.



### Configuration File Structure

BSPWM configuration resides in a single shell script located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bspwm/bspwmrc`, which typically resolves to `~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc`. This configuration file contains shell commands that invoke **bspc** to set up the window manager environment. The beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity: no special configuration language is required, and users can leverage any shell scripting capabilities to create dynamic, conditional configurations. When BSPWM starts, it executes this shell script, which should contain commands to start necessary daemons (like keyboard managers), set up monitors and desktops, configure display properties, and launch supporting applications.



## BSPWM Command Structure and Domains

### Overview of the BSPC Command

The **bspc** command functions as the exclusive interface to BSPWM, accepting a specific structure that organizes functionality into domains. The general syntax follows: `bspc DOMAIN [SELECTOR] COMMANDS`. This structure allows granular control over window manager behavior, from global settings to desktop-specific configurations to individual window manipulations. Understanding this hierarchical structure is essential for creating sophisticated configurations.

### Available Domains and Their Purposes

BSPWM organizes all functionality into six primary domains:

1. **node**: Controls individual window (node) operations
2. **desktop**: Manages desktop/workspace-level settings
3. **monitor**: Handles monitor-specific configurations
4. **query**: Retrieves metadata and state information
5. **rule**: Defines window matching and application rules
6. **wm**: Controls global window manager states

Additionally, specialized domains handle **config**, **subscribe**, and **quit** operations. The **subscribe** domain enables event-driven scripting, a powerful feature for creating dynamic window management behaviors.



## Node Domain: Individual Window Control

### Node-Specific Commands

The **node** domain manages individual windows (called nodes in BSPWM terminology). When no selector is provided, the command defaults to the focused node. All node operations follow the syntax: `bspc node [NODE_SEL] COMMAND`.

#### Focus Operations: `-f` and `--focus`

The **-f** or **--focus** flag changes focus to a specified node. When used alone, it focuses the selected node; when given a NODE_SEL argument, it focuses that specific node. For example:

- `bspc node -f west` - Focus the window to the west
- `bspc node -f biggest` - Focus the largest window

The focus command respects node selectors and modifiers, enabling complex selection patterns.

#### Activation: `-a` and `--activate`

The **-a** or **--activate** flag differs from focus by setting a node as active without necessarily giving it keyboard focus. This distinction is important in multi-monitor setups where you may want to highlight a window's visual state independently of input focus. The activate command accepts an optional NODE_SEL parameter.

#### Desktop Transfer: `-d` and `--to-desktop`

The **-d** or **--to-desktop** flag sends a node to a specified desktop. The syntax is: `bspc node -d DESKTOP_SEL`. The optional **--follow** flag can be appended to maintain focus on the moved node after transfer. For example:

- `bspc node -d '^2' --follow` - Move focused node to desktop 2 and maintain focus


#### Monitor Transfer: `-m` and `--to-monitor`

The **-m** or **--to-monitor** flag transfers a node to a specified monitor. Syntax: `bspc node -m MONITOR_SEL`. The **--follow** flag similarly maintains focus after the transfer. This is particularly useful in multi-monitor setups for dynamically redistributing windows.

#### Node-to-Node Transfer: `-n` and `--to-node`

The **-n** or **--to-node** flag moves a node to become a sibling of another specified node. This powerful operation enables precise positioning within the binary tree structure. The **--follow** flag again allows focus to follow the transferred node. Example:

- `bspc node -n newest.!automatic.local` - Move focused node to the newest preselected area


#### Swapping Nodes: `-s` and `--swap`

The **-s** or **--swap** flag exchanges positions of two nodes in the tree, effectively swapping their visual positions and tiling spaces. The syntax is: `bspc node -s NODE_SEL`. The **--follow** flag moves focus to the swapped node's new position. This differs from moving: the nodes exchange places rather than one replacing the other.

#### Preselection Direction: `-p` and `--presel-dir`

The **-p** or **--presel-dir** flag enables manual insertion mode by specifying where the next spawned window should appear relative to the current node. Valid directions are: `north`, `south`, `east`, `west`. Additionally, `~DIR` syntax cancels a preselection if it matches the specified direction. For example:

- `bspc node -p east` - Next window spawns to the east of current node
- `bspc node -p ~east` - Cancel east preselection if currently active


#### Preselection Ratio: `-o` and `--presel-ratio`

The **-o** or **--presel-ratio** flag sets the proportion of space allocated to the preselected area. The RATIO parameter must be between 0 and 1. For instance, `bspc node -o 0.4` allocates 40% of space to the preselected area and 60% to the existing content. This works in conjunction with preselection direction.

#### Node Movement: `-v` and `--move`

The **-v** or **--move** flag shifts a node's position by pixel offsets. Syntax: `bspc node -v dx dy`. Both **dx** and **dy** are pixel values representing horizontal and vertical displacement. This command is particularly useful for floating windows, allowing pixel-perfect positioning adjustments.

#### Node Resizing: `-z` and `--resize`

The **-z** or **--resize** flag adjusts node dimensions by specifying an edge and pixel adjustments. Valid edges include: `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right`, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_right`, `bottom_left`. Syntax: `bspc node -z EDGE dx dy`. The **dx** and **dy** values represent horizontal and vertical pixel adjustments. For example:

- `bspc node -z right 20 0` - Expand right edge by 20 pixels


#### Node Type/Split Cycling: `-y` and `--type`

The **-y** or **--type** flag changes or cycles the split type of a node's parent. Valid arguments are `horizontal`, `vertical`, or `next` to cycle between types. This operation rotates the tree's splitting orientation. Example:

- `bspc node -y next` - Toggle between horizontal and vertical splits


#### Split Ratio Adjustment: `-r` and `--ratio`

The **-r** or **--ratio** flag modifies the split ratio of a node's parent, controlling space distribution between siblings. Syntax: `bspc node -r RATIO` where RATIO is a decimal from 0-1, or `(+|-)(PIXELS|FRACTION)` for relative adjustments. For instance:

- `bspc node -r 0.6` - Set split ratio to 60/40
- `bspc node -r +0.05` - Increase split ratio by 5%


#### Tree Rotation: `-R` and `--rotate`

The **-R** or **--rotate** flag rotates the tree rooted at the selected node. Valid angles are: `90`, `270`, `180`. This operation is useful for dynamically rearranging window hierarchies. Example:

- `bspc node -R 90` - Rotate tree 90 degrees clockwise


#### Tree Flipping: `-F` and `--flip`

The **-F** or **--flip** flag flips the tree rooted at the selected node. Valid directions are: `horizontal`, `vertical`. This mirrors the tree structure along the specified axis. Example:

- `bspc node -F horizontal` - Flip tree horizontally


#### Tree Equalization: `-E` and `--equalize`

The **-E** or **--equalize** flag resets all split ratios within a node's subtree to their default values (typically 0.5). This is useful for restoring a balanced layout after manual ratio adjustments.

#### Tree Balancing: `-B` and `--balance`

The **-B** or **--balance** flag adjusts split ratios within a subtree so all leaves occupy equal area. Unlike equalization, which resets all ratios identically, balancing respects the existing tree structure while equalizing final window areas.

#### Tree Circulation: `-C` and `--circulate`

The **-C** or **--circulate** flag moves windows within a tree in a circular pattern. Valid directions are: `forward`, `backward`. This operation is particularly useful for dynamic window rotation without explicit swapping.

#### Node State: `-t` and `--state`

The **-t** or **--state** flag changes a node's state (tiling mode). Valid states are: `tiled`, `pseudo_tiled`, `floating`, `fullscreen`. The `~` prefix toggles to the previous state if the current state matches, or restores the previous state if no state is specified. Syntax: `bspc node -t STATE`. Examples:

- `bspc node -t floating` - Make window floating
- `bspc node -t ~floating` - Toggle floating state


#### Node Flags: `-g` and `--flag`

The **-g** or **--flag** flag manages binary flags that modify node behavior. Valid flags are: `hidden`, `sticky`, `private`, `locked`, `marked`, `urgent`. The flag syntax accepts optional `=on|off` to explicitly set state. Each flag serves a specific purpose:

- **hidden**: Node is hidden and doesn't occupy tiling space
- **sticky**: Node stays on the focused desktop of its monitor
- **private**: Node resists movement and resizing during automatic insertion
- **locked**: Node ignores the close (`-c`) message
- **marked**: Arbitrary flag used for custom operations; unmarked automatically when sent to a preselected node
- **urgent**: Indicates window urgency (typically set externally); used for window selection

Examples:

- `bspc node -g sticky=on` - Make window sticky
- `bspc node -g marked` - Toggle marked flag


#### Node Layering: `-l` and `--layer`

The **-l** or **--layer** flag changes a node's stacking layer. Valid layers are: `below`, `normal`, `above`. BSPWM maintains three stacking layers where below < normal < above, and within each layer: tiled/pseudo_tiled < floating < fullscreen. Examples:

- `bspc node -l above` - Place window above all others
- `bspc node -l below` - Place window below all others


#### Receptacle Insertion: `-i` and `--insert-receptacle`

The **-i** or `--insert-receptacle` flag creates a receptacle (empty leaf node) at the selected node's position. Receptacles are particularly useful for creating predefined layouts that can be filled with windows later.

#### Node Closure: `-c` and `--close`

The **-c** or **--close** flag closes a node by sending it the close message. This respects the `locked` flag; if set, the message is ignored.

#### Node Termination: `-k` and **--kill**

The **-k** or **--kill** flag forcibly terminates a node's window regardless of flags or settings. This is a hard termination that bypasses all safety mechanisms.

### Node Selector Syntax

Node selectors determine which nodes are affected by commands. They follow the pattern: `[REFERENCE#]DESCRIPTOR[.MODIFIER]*`.

#### Node Descriptors

Descriptors specify the initial node selection:

- **DIR** (north|west|south|east): Relative direction
- **CYCLE_DIR** (next|prev): Cyclic direction
- **any**: Any node
- **first_ancestor**: First non-leaf ancestor

- `bspc desktop -f '^2'` - Focus the 2nd desktop
- `bspc desktop -f next` - Focus next desktop


#### Desktop Activation: `-a` and `--activate`

The **-a** or **--activate** flag sets a desktop as active (similar to node activation). This is distinct from focus and is useful in multi-monitor scenarios.

#### Desktop Transfer to Monitor: `-m` and `--to-monitor`

The **-m** or `--to-monitor` flag transfers a desktop to a different monitor. Syntax: `bspc desktop -m MONITOR_SEL`. The optional **--follow** flag moves focus to the transferred desktop.

## Wm Domain: Window Manager State

### Global Window Manager Operations

The **wm** domain controls global window manager state and operations.

#### Dump State: `-d` and `--dump-state`

The **-d** or `--dump-state` flag outputs the complete window manager state. This is useful for backing up configurations or analysis.

#### Load State: `-l` and `--load-state`

The **-l** or `--load-state** flag restores a previously dumped state. Syntax: `bspc wm -l <file_path>`.

#### Add Monitor: `-a` and `--add-monitor`

The **-a** or `--add-monitor` flag manually adds a monitor to management. Syntax: `bspc wm -a <name> WxH+X+Y`. Useful for dynamic monitor addition.

#### Reorder Monitors: `-O` and `--reorder-monitors`

The **-O** or `--reorder-monitors` flag changes the global monitor order. Syntax: `bspc wm -O <name>...`.

#### Adopt Orphans: `-o` and `--adopt-orphans`

The **-o** or `--adopt-orphans` flag brings unmanaged windows under BSPWM control.

#### Record History: `-h` and `--record-history`

The **-h** or `--record-history** flag enables/disables command history logging. Syntax: `bspc wm -h on|off`.

#### Get Status: `-g` and `--get-status`

The **-g** or `--get-status` flag outputs the current status.

#### Restart: `-r` and `--restart`

The **-r** or `--restart** flag restarts BSPWM while preserving windows. This is useful during configuration updates.



## Window States and Flags

### Window States

Each window maintains exactly one state at any time:

#### Tiled

**Tiled** state means the window fills its assigned tiling space without overlapping others. Windows are arranged according to the binary tree structure. This is the default state for new windows.

#### Pseudo-Tiled

**Pseudo-tiled** windows respect ICCCM size hints while being centered within their tiling space. They can be resized but maintain their centered position.

#### Floating

**Floating** windows can be positioned and resized freely anywhere on the desktop. They don't participate in automatic tiling but remain part of the node tree.

#### Fullscreen

**Fullscreen** windows occupy their monitor's entire rectangle with no borders. They're placed above other content. When a fullscreen window is present and a new floating window is created, BSPWM must change the fullscreen window to tiled to display the floating window on top, unless the floating window is placed on the above layer.

### Window Flags

Flags are independent states that can be combined:

#### Hidden

**Hidden** windows don't occupy tiling space and aren't visible. They're useful for implementing scratchpads and minimization-like functionality.

#### Sticky

**Sticky** windows follow the focused desktop on their monitor. When switching desktops, sticky windows appear on the new desktop.

#### Private

**Private** windows resist movement and resizing during automatic insertion. When inserting new windows into automatic mode, private nodes maintain their position and size rather than being split.

#### Locked

**Locked** windows ignore the close message sent by `bspc node -c`. They require forceful termination with `bspc node -k`.

#### Marked

**Marked** is an arbitrary flag useful for custom operations. It's particularly valuable in conjunction with preselection to implement deferred window movement. Marked nodes automatically become unmarked when sent to a preselected node.

#### Urgent

**Urgent** indicates a window requiring attention. It's typically set externally by applications (e.g., when incoming messages arrive). BSPWM uses this flag for window selection.



## Stacking Layers

BSPWM implements three independent stacking layers:

1. **below**: Lowest layer
2. **normal**: Middle layer (default)
3. **above**: Top layer

Within each layer, the window order follows: tiled \& pseudo_tiled < floating < fullscreen. This means a floating window on the "below" layer appears above tiled windows on that layer but below all windows on the "normal" layer.



## Advanced Configuration Patterns and Techniques

### Monitor Setup and Multi-Monitor Configuration

Setting up monitors requires careful use of the monitor domain commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example multi-monitor setup

# External monitor setup
bspc monitor eDP1 -d I II III IV V
bspc monitor HDMI1 -d VI VII VIII IX X

# Alternative: Conditional setup
if xrandr | grep -q "HDMI1 connected"; then
    xrandr --output HDMI1 --right-of eDP1 --auto
    bspc monitor eDP1 -d I II III IV
    bspc monitor HDMI1 -d V VI VII VIII
fi
```


### Floating Desktop Configuration

Creating desktops where all windows float by default:

```bash
bspc rule -a "*" -o desktop=floating_desktop state=floating
bspc desktop floating_desktop -l tiled  # or any layout
```


### Scratchpad/Dropdown Terminal Implementation

Using hidden sticky windows to create dropdown terminal functionality:

```bash
# Create dropdown terminal rule
bspc rule -a dropdown -o sticky=on state=floating hidden=on rectangle=800x600+560+240

# Launch dropdown terminal
alacritty --class dropdown -e zsh &

# Toggle script
bspc node any.hidden.sticky -g hidden -f
```


### Receptacle-Based Manual Layouts

Using receptacles to build predefined layouts:

```bash
# Create three-pane layout with receptacles
bspc node -i
bspc node -p west -o 0.5
bspc node -i
bspc node -p south
bspc node -i

# Fill receptacles with windows - they automatically slot into place
```


### External Rules for Complex Logic

When built-in rules aren't sufficient, external rule scripts provide unlimited flexibility:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /home/user/.config/bspwm/external_rules

wid=$1
class=$2
instance=$3

case "$class" in
    Firefox)
        if [ "$instance" = "firefox" ]; then
            echo "desktop=^1 follow=on"
        else
            echo "desktop=^2"  # Private browsing to different desktop
        fi
        ;;
    Blender)
        echo "state=floating rectangle=1920x1080+0+0"
        ;;
    *)
        # Default behavior
        ;;
esac
```


### Event-Driven Automatic Layouts

Using subscribe to dynamically adapt behavior:

```bash
# Automatically switch to monocle in fullscreen windows
bspc subscribe node_state | while read -a msg; do
    if [ "${msg[^1_8]}" = "fullscreen" ] && [ "${msg[^1_9]}" = "on" ]; then
        desk_id=$(echo "${msg[^1_1]}" | cut -d':' -f2)
        bspc desktop "$desk_id" -l monocle
    fi
done &
```


### Node ID Tracking and Manipulation

Storing and using node IDs for complex operations:

```bash
# Store node ID and move it later
id=$(bspc query -N -n)
# ... perform other operations ...
bspc node "$id" -d '^2'  # Move stored node to desktop 2
```


### Custom Layouts with Master Stack

While BSPWM provides only tiled and monocle, external scripts enable layouts like master-stack:

```bash
# Balance 3-pane layout
bspc node @/ -B
bspc node @/1 -r 0.66  # Make left side 66% of space
```


### Pointer Action Configuration

Setting up mouse controls for floating window manipulation:

```bash
# Configure pointer modifier and actions
bspc config pointer_modifier mod1          # Use Alt key
bspc config pointer_action1 move           # Alt+Button1 moves
bspc config pointer_action2 resize_side    # Alt+Button2 resizes edge
bspc config pointer_action3 resize_corner  # Alt+Button3 resizes corner
```


### Query-Based Window Selection

Complex window selection using query syntax:

```bash
# Find biggest window on current desktop and close it
biggest=$(bspc query -N -n biggest.local.!fullscreen.window)
bspc node "$biggest" -c

# Focus all windows of same class
class=$(bspc query -N -n | xargs -I {} xprop -id {} WM_CLASS | cut -d'"' -f2 | head -1)
bspc node ".same_class" -f
```


### Tree Manipulation Example

Using rotate, flip, and balance for dynamic layouts:

```bash
# Rotate current desktop tree 90 degrees
bspc node @/ -R 90

# Flip tree horizontally
bspc node @/ -F horizontal

# Balance all split ratios for equal window sizes
bspc node @/ -B

# Equal spacing (reset all ratios)
bspc node @/ -E
```


### Comprehensive Configuration Template

A sophisticated bspwmrc demonstrating multiple techniques:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc

# Start sxhkd for keybindings
sxhkd &

# Monitor setup
if xrandr | grep -q "HDMI1 connected"; then
    xrandr --output HDMI1 --right-of eDP1 --auto
    bspc monitor eDP1 -d 1 2 3 4 5
    bspc monitor HDMI1 -d 6 7 8 9 10
else
    bspc monitor -d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
fi

## So Far

* BSPWM represents a paradigm shift in window manager configuration philosophy. Rather than implementing every feature directly within the window manager, BSPWM provides a powerful, scriptable interface through **bspc** that enables users to build sophisticated configurations entirely from shell scripts. This approach offers unprecedented flexibility and transparency—users can see exactly what commands are being executed and modify them without learning specialized syntax.

* The comprehensive command set across six domains (node, desktop, monitor, query, rule, wm) combined with powerful selector syntax enables precise control over every aspect of window management. Advanced features like event subscription, external rule scripts, and tree manipulation operations provide the foundation for highly customized window management workflows.

* Mastering BSPWM configuration requires understanding the hierarchical structure of selectors, the binary tree model of window arrangement, and how to combine simple commands into complex behaviors. The sophisticated user can leverage all documented flags and options to create configurations that adapt dynamically to their workflow, automating complex window management scenarios through scripting and event handling.

* This documentation provides the authoritative reference for every flag, option, and configuration technique available in BSPWM, extracted from official sources and community expertise, enabling users to build the most sophisticated window management configurations possible.
